## Q.1

Source: The file contains data extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend
US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32
automobiles (1973â€“74 models). The dataset contains 32 observations on 11 variables.

```{r}
mtcars <- read.table("mtcars.csv",sep = ",", header=TRUE)

head(mtcars)
# colMeans(mtcars[,2:11])


# apply(mtcars[,2:11], 2, var)

typeof(mtcars)

plot(x = mtcars$wt, y = mtcars$mpg,
     xlab = "Weight", ylab = "Miles Per Gallon",	 
     main = "Weight vs. miles per gallon")
```
## The scatter plot shows a decreasing linear relationship between mpg and weight which can be investigated further if the relationship is statistically significant.

## Q. 2
```{r}

library("scatterplot3d")
scatterplot3d(x = mtcars$wt, y = mtcars$mpg, z=mtcars$cyl,
              xlab = "Weight", ylab = "Miles Per Gallon",	zlab="Cylinders", 
              color="red", pch=20)
```
### One of the drawback of 3d scatter-plot is that the interpretation of relationships between the variables can be difficult to observe. An alternative can be to plot a 2d catter plot b/w mpg and weight and colorcode the points according to cylinder variable.


## Q. 3

```{r}

pairs(mtcars[,2:11], pch=20)

```
## Q.4

If we look at the 2d scatter plot, and color code the points accoring to the number of cylinders, we can see that the points cluster into 3 groups according to the number of cylinders. Therefore, the engineer's suggestions reasonable.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl)))
```
