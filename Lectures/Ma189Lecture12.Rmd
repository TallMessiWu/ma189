# Multivariate ANOVA 

- Suppose we measure $m$ variables over $g$ populations. For the $k$th population, we observe a sample of size $n_k$.
- The dataset can be summarized in this table. Superscript denotes the population, whereas row and column index refer to record and variable respectively:
\[
 \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc}   & 1 & 2 & \ldots & g \\
    1 & x_{11}^{(1)}, \ldots, x_{1m}^{(1)} & x_{11}^{(2)}, \ldots, x_{1m}^{(2)}  &
      \ldots & x_{11}^{(g)}, \ldots, x_{1m}^{(g)} \\
    2 & x_{21}^{(1)}, \ldots, x_{2m}^{(1)} & x_{21}^{(2)}, \ldots, x_{2m}^{(2)} & 
    \ldots & x_{21}^{(g)}, \ldots, x_{2m}^{(g)}  \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    n_k & x_{n_1,1}^{(1)}, \ldots, x_{n_1,m}^{(1)} & x_{n_2,1}^{(2)}, \ldots, x_{n_2,m}^{(2)} &
    \ldots & x_{n_g,1}^{(g)}, \ldots, x_{n_g,m}^{(g)} 
\end{array}  \right]
\]

### Notation:

- $x_{ij}^{(k)}$ is $i$th observation of the $j$th variable in the $k$th population
- $n_k$ is number of observations in $k$th population
- $N = n_1 + \ldots + n_g$ is total sample size
- $g$ is the  number of treatments/populations/samples

## MANOVA

- The assumptions here are essentially the same as the univariate ANOVA, except we have $m$ variables.
1. The data from group $k$ has common mean vector $\underline{\mu}^{(k)}$, i.e., 
\[
  {\mathbb E} [ x_{ij}^{(k)} ] = \underline{\mu}_j^{(k)}.
\]
 (The $m$ components of the vector correspond to the $m$ variables.)
2. Homoskedasticity: The data from all groups have common covariance matrix ${\mathbf \Sigma}$, i.e.,
\[
  {\mathbf \Sigma} = \mbox{Cov} [ \underline{x}_i^{(k)}, \underline{x}_i^{(k)}]
\]
 for any record $i$, and the matrix does not depend on $k$ (the group index).
3. Independence: The observations are independently sampled.
4. Normality: The data are multivariate normally distributed.


- We are interested in testing the null hypothesis that all group mean vectors are equal:
\[
 H_0:  \underline{\mu}^{(1)} = \underline{\mu}^{(2)} = \ldots = \underline{\mu}^{(g)}
 \quad \mbox{versus} \quad H_a: \mu_j^{(k)} \neq \mu_{j}^{(h)} 
\]
 for some variable $j$, and for some groups $k$ and $h$.
- This says that the null hypothesis is false if at least one pair of treatments is different on at least one variable.

## Total Sum of Squares and Cross Products

- Consider the following notation:
\[
  \overline{\underline{x}}^{(k)} = \frac{1}{n_k} \sum_{i=1}^{n_k}  \underline{x}_{i}^{(k)},
\]
 which is the sample mean vector of $k$th sample (so it gives sample means for all the variables, for the $k$th sample).
\[
 \overline{\underline{x}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^g  \sum_{i=1}^{n_k}  \underline{x}_{i}^{(k)},
\]
 which is the Grand mean vector (overall sample mean).
- The multivariate analog is the Total Sum of Squares and is a cross products matrix of size $m \times m$:
\[
  {\mathbf T} = \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} { \left( \underline{x}_i^{(k)} - \overline{\underline{x}}  \right) } 
  { \left( \underline{x}_i^{(k)} - \overline{\underline{x}}  \right) }^{\prime} 
\]
- The diagonal entries of ${\mathbf T}$ are the total sum of squares of each variable.
- The off-diagonal entries of  ${\mathbf T}$  measure the dependence of two variables across all observations.

## Partitioning Total Sum of Squares ${\mathbf T}$

- We may partition the total sum of squares and cross products as follows:
\begin{align*}
  {\mathbf T} & = \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} { \left( \underline{x}_i^{(k)} -  \overline{\underline{x}}  \right) } 
  { \left( \underline{x}_i^{(k)} - \overline{\underline{x}}  \right) }^{\prime}  \\
& = \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} { \left\{ \left( \underline{x}_i^{(k)} - 
\overline{\underline{x}}^{(k)} \right) + \left( \overline{\underline{x}}^{(k)} -
  \overline{\underline{x}} \right) \right\} } 
{ \left\{ \left( \underline{x}_i^{(k)} - 
\overline{\underline{x}}^{(k)} \right) + \left( \overline{\underline{x}}^{(k)} -
  \overline{\underline{x}} \right) \right\} }^{\prime}   \\
 & = \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} {   \left( \underline{x}_i^{(k)} - 
\overline{\underline{x}}^{(k)} \right)   } 
{  \left( \underline{x}_i^{(k)} - \overline{\underline{x}}^{(k)} \right)  }^{\prime}  +
    \sum_{k=1}^g  n_k {   \left( \overline{\underline{x}}^{(k)} -
  \overline{\underline{x}} \right)  } 
{  \left( \overline{\underline{x}}^{(k)} -
  \overline{\underline{x}} \right)  }^{\prime}.
\end{align*}
- Call the first term ${\mathbf E}$, the Error Sum of Squares and Cross Products.
- Call the second term ${\mathbf H}$, the Hypothesis Sum of Squares and Cross Products.
- We tend to reject the null hypothesis
\[
 H_0:  \underline{\mu}^{(1)} = \underline{\mu}^{(2)} = \ldots = \underline{\mu}^{(g)}
\]
if the Hypothesis Sum of Squares and Cross Products matrix ${\mathbf H}$ is "large" relative to the Error Sum of Squares and Cross Products matrix ${\mathbf E}$.
- What do we mean by "large" when comparing two matrices?

## Wilks’s Lambda (Ratio of Determinants)

- The first test statistic for Multivariate ANOVA is named *Wilks’s Lambda*, which is named after American statistician Samuel S. Wilks:
\[
 \Lambda = \frac{ \det {\mathbf E} }{ \det {\mathbf T}} = 
 \frac{ \det {\mathbf E} }{ \det \left( {\mathbf E}  + {\mathbf H} \right) }.
\]
- Here ${\mathbf E}$ is the Error Sum of Squares and Cross Products, ${\mathbf H}$ is the Hypothesis Sum of Squares and Cross Products, and ${\mathbf T}$ is the Total Sum of Squares and Cross Products.
Also $\det$ denotes the determinant of a matrix.
- The Wilks’s Lambda statistic follows a Lambda distribution. In general, we will reject the null hypothesis if Wilks’s lambda is small (close to zero).
- The Wilks's Lambda distribution depends on $p$ (the number of variables), and degrees of freedom $N-g$ and $g-1$. If $N-g$ is large, we have the approximation
\begin{align*}
 \xi & = \begin{cases}  \sqrt{ \frac{ p^2 {(g-1)}^2 - 4}{ p^2 + {(g-1)}^2 - 5}} \; \mbox{if} \;   p^2 + {(g-1)}^2 - 5  > 0 \\
  1 \qquad \mbox{else}  \end{cases} \\
  \omega & = \frac{ p (g-1) -2}{2} \\
  d_1 & = p (g-1) \\
 d_2 & = \left( (N-g) - (p - g + 2)/2 \right) \xi - \omega \\
 \frac{d_2 \, (1 - \Lambda^{1/\xi})}{ d_1 \, \Lambda^{1/\xi}} & \sim
 \mathcal{F}_{d_1,d_2}
\end{align*}

## Pillai’s Trace (Trace of Ratio)

- The second test statistic for Multivariate ANOVA is named *Pillai’s Trace*:
\[
  V = \mbox{tr} \left[ {\mathbf H} { \left( {\mathbf H} + {\mathbf E} \right) }^{-1}  \right],
\]
where ${\mathbf E}$ is the Error Sum of Squares and Cross Products and ${\mathbf H}$ is the Hypothesis Sum of Squares and Cross Products. Also $\mbox{tr}$ denotes the trace of a matrix.
- If ${\mathbf H}$ is large relative to ${\mathbf E}$ then Pillai’s Trace will take a large value. Thus, we reject the null hypothesis if this test statistic is large.
- Pillai’s Trace can be transformed to an $F$-statistic up to a scaling factor depending on the data:
\begin{align*}
  s &  = \min \{ p, g-1 \} \\
  m &  = ( | p - g + 1| - 1)/2 \\
  r & = (N-g -p -1)/2 \\
  d_1 & = 2 r + s + 1\\
  d_2 & = 2 m + s + 1 \\
  \frac{ d_1 V }{ d_2 ( s- V)} & \sim \mathcal{F}_{s d_2, s d_1 }
\end{align*}

## Hotelling-Lawley Trace (Trace of Ratio)

- The third test statistic for Multivariate ANOVA is named the *Hotelling-Lawley Trace*, which is defined as
\[
 U = \mbox{tr} \left[ {\mathbf H} {  {\mathbf E}   }^{-1}  \right],
\]
where ${\mathbf E}$ is the Error Sum of Squares and Cross Products and ${\mathbf H}$ is the Hypothesis Sum of Squares and Cross Products.  
- If ${\mathbf H}$ is large relative to ${\mathbf E}$ then the Hotelling-Lawley Trace will take a large value. Thus, we reject the null hypothesis if this test statistic is large.
- Hotelling-Lawley Trace can be transformed to an $F$-statistic up to a scaling factor, depending on the data:
\begin{align*}
 b & = \frac{(N-p-2)(N-g-1)}{(N-g-p-3)(N-g-p)} \\
 d_1 & = p (g-1) \\
 d_2 & = 4 + \frac{d_1 +2}{b-1} \\
 c & = \frac{ d_1 (d_2-2)}{ d_2 (N-g-p-1)} \\
  U/c & \sim \mathcal{F}_{d_1,d_2}
\end{align*}
 It is slightly simpler than Pillai’s Trace.
 
## Roy’s Maximum Root (Largest Eigenvalue of Ratio)

- The fourth test statistic for Multivariate ANOVA is named *Roy’s Maximum Root*, which is defined as
\[
 R = \lambda_m  \left[ {\mathbf H} {  {\mathbf E}   }^{-1}  \right],
\]
where ${\mathbf E}$ is the Error Sum of Squares and Cross Products and ${\mathbf H}$ is the Hypothesis Sum of Squares and Cross Products.  Also $\lambda_m$ denotes the largest  eigenvalue of a $m \times m$-dimensional matrix.
- If ${\mathbf H}$ is large relative to ${\mathbf E}$, then the Roy’s Maximum Root will take a large value. Thus, we reject the null hypothesis if this test statistic is large.
- Roy’s Maximum Root can also be transformed to an $F$-statistic up to a scaling factor depending on the data.
\[
  F = t \, R,
\]
 for some data-dependent parameter $t$.
- There is an R package to numerically compute the distribution of 
\[
  \frac{R}{1+R}.
\]
 
 
## Example: Romano-British Pottery data

- Recall the null and alternative hypothesis
\[
 H_0:  \underline{\mu}^{(1)} = \underline{\mu}^{(2)} = \ldots = \underline{\mu}^{(g)}
 \quad \mbox{versus} \quad H_a: \mu_j^{(k)} \neq \mu_{j}^{(h)} 
\]
 for some variable $j$, and for some groups $k$ and $h$.
- Associated Question: Is there at least one chemical that varies significantly over at least one pair of sites?
- What is the difference compared with univariate ANOVA?
1. The alternative hypothesis is different. (Answering different questions!)
2. The correlation among variables is ignored in univariate case.
3. Interpretation will be different. 
- Let’s compare the MANOVA test results for the four test statistics
1. Wilks’ Lambda: $\Lambda = \det  {\mathbf E} / \det {\mathbf T}$.
2. Pillai’s Trace:  $V = \mbox{tr} [ {\mathbf H} { ( {\mathbf H} + {\mathbf E} ) }^{-1} ]$
3. Hotelling-Lawley Trace:  $U = \mbox{tr} [ {\mathbf H} { {\mathbf E}  }^{-1} ]$
4. Roy’s Maximum Root: $R = \lambda_m [ {\mathbf H} { {\mathbf E}  }^{-1} ]$
- A common procedure can be summarized as follows:
1. Calculate ${\mathbf E}$ and ${\mathbf H}$.
2. Calculate test statistic.
3. Transform the test statistic to an $F$-statistic.
4. Calculate critical value or p-value, and make conclusion.

### Error Sum of Squares and Cross Products Matrix 

- Can be calculated as follows:
\[
 {\mathbf E} = \sum_{k=1}^g \sum_{i=1}^{n_k} {   \left( \underline{x}_i^{(k)} - 
\overline{\underline{x}}^{(k)} \right)   } 
{  \left( \underline{x}_i^{(k)} - \overline{\underline{x}}^{(k)} \right)  }^{\prime}.
\]
- Code: group data into a data matrix that is $n_k \times m$ for each population $k$.
- The results are below:
```{r}
ESS <- cov(x2)*(n2-1) + cov(x3)*(n3-1) + cov(x4)*(n4-1) + cov(x5)*(n5-1)
ESS
```

### Hypothesis Sum of Squares and Cross Products Matrix 

- Can be calculated as follows:
\[
 {\mathbf H} = 
 \sum_{k=1}^g  n_k {   \left( \overline{\underline{x}}^{(k)} -
  \overline{\underline{x}} \right)  } 
{  \left( \overline{\underline{x}}^{(k)} -
  \overline{\underline{x}} \right)  }^{\prime}.
\]
- Code: group data into a data matrix that is $n_k \times m$ for each population $k$.
- The results are below:
```{r}
HSS <- n2*(m2 - mg) %*% t(m2 - mg) + n3*(m3 - mg) %*% t(m3 - mg) +
  n4*(m4 - mg) %*% t(m4 - mg) + n5*(m5 - mg) %*% t(m5 - mg)
HSS
```

### Four Test Statistics

- After calculating ${\mathbf E}$ and ${\mathbf H}$, we can calculate the four test statistics.
- In the table below, we list the calculated test statistics, associated $F$-statistics, and their
p-values.

```{r}
library(rootWishart)
N <- n2+n3+n4+n5
g <- 4
p <- 5
output <- NULL

# Wilks Lambda
wilks <- det(ESS)/det(ESS + HSS)
wilk_f <- ((N - g) - (p - g + 2)/2)
wilk_xi <- 1
if((p^2 + (g-1)^2 - 5) > 0) 
{
  wilk_xi <- sqrt((p^2*(g-1)^2 - 4)/(p^2 + (g-1)^2 - 5))
}
wilk_omega <- (p*(g-1)-2 )/2
wilks_stat <- (wilk_f*wilk_xi - wilk_omega)*
  (1 - wilks^(1/wilk_xi))/(p*(g-1)*wilks^(1/wilk_xi))
output <- rbind(output,c(wilks,wilks_stat,
  1 - pf(wilks_stat,df1 = p*(g-1), df2 = (wilk_f*wilk_xi - wilk_omega))))

# Pillai's Trace
pillai <- sum(diag(HSS %*% solve(ESS + HSS)))
pillai_s <- min(p,g-1)
pillai_m <- (abs(p-g+1)-1)/2
pillai_r <- (N-g-p-1)/2
pillai_stat <- (2*pillai_r + pillai_s + 1)*pillai/
  ((2*pillai_m + pillai_s + 1)*(pillai_s - pillai))
output <- rbind(output,c(pillai,pillai_stat,
  1 - pf(pillai_stat,df1 = pillai_s*(2*pillai_m + pillai_s + 1),
       df2 = pillai_s*(2*pillai_r + pillai_s + 1))))

# Hotelling-Lawley
hotel <- sum(diag(HSS %*% solve(ESS)))
hotel_b <- (N-p-2)*(N-g-1)/((N-g-p-3)*(N-g-p))
hotel_df1 <- p*(g-1)
hotel_df2 <- 4 + (hotel_df1 + 2)/(hotel_b - 1)
hotel_c <- hotel_df1*(hotel_df2 - 2)/(hotel_df2*(N-g-p-1))
hotel_stat <- hotel/hotel_c
output <- rbind(output,c(hotel,hotel_stat,
  1 - pf(hotel_stat,df1 = hotel_df1,df2 = hotel_df2)))

# Roy
roy <- max(eigen(HSS %*% solve(ESS))$values)
roy_stat <- roy/(1+roy)
output <- rbind(output,c(roy,roy_stat,
  1 - doubleWishart(roy_stat,p=p,m=N-g,n=g-1)))

colnames(output) <- c("Statistic","Test Statistic","P-value")
rownames(output) <- c("Wilks","Pillai","Hotelling-Lawley","Roy")
output
```
