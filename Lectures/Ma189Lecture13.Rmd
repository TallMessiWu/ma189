# Classification

So far we have examined how to compare the means of more than two samples:
- Multiple-sample testing
- Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
- Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)

Next we study **classification**, with a particular focus on the *linear discriminant analysis* method. Some topics:
1. The classification problems
2. Bayes’ rule in classification
3. Linear discriminant analysis

# Qualitative variables

- Qualitative, or categorical, variables are very common in many datasets. They naturally reflect the discrete (or unordered) properties of observations.  
- When a qualitative variable contains only two outcomes, it is also called a *binary variable*.

Examples of unordered variables:
- Gender, blood type, smoking history, eye color of patients.
- The political party that a voter might vote for.
- Four nucleobases (A,G,T,C) of a DNA double helix.
- Nationalities of students in a department.
- Authenticity of a bank note (recall the swiss banknotes dataset).
- Location of pottery shards (recall the pottery dataset).

# Classification

- The process to predict a qualitative variable is called *classification*. Or we can say that
we classify that observation into a class/group/category. The statistical tools to classify the observations are called *classifiers*.

Examples:
- A patient arrives at the emergency room with a set of symptoms that could possibly be
attributed to one of the three medical conditions. Which one of the three does this patient
have?
- An online banking service must be able to determine whether or not a transaction being
processed on the site is fraudulent, on the basis of the user’s IP address, transaction history, etc.
- On the basis of DNA sequence data for a number of patients with and without a given
disease, a biologist would like to determine which DNA mutations are dependent (disease-causing) and which are not.


## Classification versus Regression

Classification problems are different, but connected to regression problems!

### Classification

- Predict qualitative variables
- Rarely interested in population parameters
- With or without a response variable
- Many methods first predict the probability of each category. In this sense, they behave like regression methods

### Regression

- Predict quantitative variables
- Inference on population parameters
- Require a response variable to formulate the problem
- Response variable can be qualitative (e.g., logistic regression)

## Two Types of Classification

- In general, there are two types of classification problems: *supervised* and *un-supervised*, depending on whether we know (or partially know) the true values of the qualitative variables in the data.

### Supervised Classification

- We observed a sample in which we know the true class labels. We usually call this sample a *training set*.
- The true labels in the training set can "supervise" us to train a classifier.
- When we observe a sample without labelling, we can classify them using the classifier learned from the training set.

### Un-supervised Classification

- Sometimes we observe a sample without knowing the true class labels.  Maybe there are no true class labels at all. There are also cases in which we do not even know how many groups/categories the variables belong to.
- We design a cost function based on the our objective. We classify the observations in order to minimize the cost function.
- Often, this is more challenging than supervised classification.

## Linear Discriminant Analysis

- *Linear discriminant analysis* (LDA) is a statistical tool with an objective to solve a classification problem when the groups are known as a priori.
- LDA was developed (again!) by British statistician Ronald Fisher. Therefore, sometimes LDA is also called *Fisher’s Linear discriminant analysis*.
- LDA is different from ANOVA, as it is used to predict the group membership of an observation.
- LDA and ANOVA are closely related!
