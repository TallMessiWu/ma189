## Leave-One-Out Cross Validation

- Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) is closely related to the validation set approach. It attempts to address the drawbacks ofthe latter.
- Instead of randomly dividing the sample into a training set and a validation set, LOOCV doesit in an alternating way:

1. Pick the first observation $(x_1, y_1)$ as the validation set, and use the remaining observations $(x_2,y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ as the training set. The testing error is measured as 
\[
 \mbox{MSPE}_1 = {(y_1 - \widehat{y}_1 )}^2.
\]
2. Pick  $(x_2, y_2)$ as the validation set, and use the remaining observations as the training set. The testing error is measured as 
\[
 \mbox{MSPE}_2 = {(y_2 - \widehat{y}_2 )}^2.
\]
3. Repeat for each observation in the sample and obtain
\[
 \mbox{MSPE}_i = {(y_i - \widehat{y}_i )}^2.
\]
4. The tesing error is the average of the mean square prediction errors:
\[
  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mbox{MSPE}_i = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n  
  {(y_i - \widehat{y}_i )}^2.
\]

## Leave-one-out CV versus Validation Set

### Leave-one-out CV

- Repeatedly fit the statistical learning method using training sets that contain $n-1$ observations.
- Less bias, because the training set is close to the whole sample.
- Avoid overestimating the test error.
- Yield same results when applied multiple times.
- Expensive computational cost, as the model has to be fit $n$ times.

### Validation set

- Fit the statistical learning method using a random sub-sample.
- Large bias, as we used smaller sample size to train the model.
- May over-estimate the test error.
- Yield different results when applied repeatedly, due to random training-validation splitting.
- Fast computation, because model is only trained once.

## $K$-fold Cross Validation

- An alternative to LOOCV is $K$-fold CV. This approach involves randomly dividing the set of observations into $K$ groups, or folds, of approximately equal size.
- $K$-fold CV also works in a repeated way:

1. Pick the first fold as the validation set, and use the remaining $K-1$ folds as the training set. The test error $\mbox{MSPE}_1$ is computed on the observations in first fold.
2. Repeat step 1 by using each fold as the validation set and use the remaining $K-1$ folds as the training set. The test errors  $\mbox{MSPE}_2, \ldots, \mbox{MSPE}_K$ are computed on the observations in the held-out fold.
3. The tesing error is the average of the mean square prediction errors:
\[
  \frac{1}{K} \sum_{j=1}^K \mbox{MSPE}_j.
\]
- LOOCV can be considered as a special $K$-fold CV with $K = n$.
- In practice, we usually perform $K$-fold CV using $K=5$ or $K= 10$.

## Advantages of $K$-fold Cross Validation

- Both LOOCV and $K$-fold CV are very general resampling methods, and can be used on many kinds of predictive learning processes.
- In general, $K$-fold CV (with $K=5$ or $K= 10$) is more popular than LOOCV.
- What are the advantages of $K$-fold CV?

### First Advantage 

- The most obvious advantage is *computational feasibility*. 
- LOOCV requires fitting the statistical learning method $n$ times. This has the potential to be computationally expensive when $n$ is large, or fitting is computationally intensive.
- $K$-fold CV only requires fitting the statistical learning method $K$ times.

### Second Advantage

- A less obvious but potentially more important advantage of $K$-fold CV is that it often gives more accurate estimates of the testing error rate than LOOCV. This has to do with a *bias-variance* trade-off.


## Bias-Variance Trade-off in Cross Validation

### Bias:

- The validation set approach tends to have large bias. The model is trained with a smaller sample size. The validation set approach tends to overestimate the test error.
- Using this logic, the LOOCV will give approximately unbiased estimates of the test error.
Each training set contains $n-1$ observations, which is almost as many as the number of observations in the full dataset.
- And performing $K$-fold CV will lead to an intermediate level of bias. Each training set contains $(K-1) n/K$ observations; fewer than in the LOOCV approach, but substantially more than in the validation set approach.

### Variance:

- On the other hand, LOOCV has a high level of variance.

1. When we perform LOOCV, we are in effect averaging the outputs of $n$ fitted models, each of which is trained on an almost identical set of observations; therefore, these outputs are highly (positively) correlated with each other.
2. The mean of many highly correlated quantities has higher variance than the mean of many variables that are less correlated.

- In contrast, $K$-fold CV with $K < n$ has a smaller variance. We are averaging the outputs of $K$ fitted models that are somewhat less correlated with each other, since the overlap between the training sets in each model is smaller.

### Summary of Trade-off

- To summarize, there is a bias-variance trade-off associated with the choice of $K$ in $K$-fold CV.
- Typically, given these considerations, popular choices of $K =5$ or $K= 10$ have been shown empirically to yield test error estimates that suffer neither from excessively high bias nor from very high variance.

## Example: Predict MPG with Horsepower

- We return to the automobiles dataset.
- Now we compare the test errors estimated by LOOCV and $8$-fold CV (I chose $K=8$ because it divides $n = 392$).

## Cross Validation on Classification Problems

- We have illustrated the use of cross-validation in the regression setting where the outcome
$y$ is quantitative. The test error is quantified by the $\mbox{MSPE}$.
- Cross-validation can also be a very useful approach in the classification setting, when $y$ is qualitative (or categorical).
- In classification problems, we can quantify test error by the number of misclassified observations.
- For instance, in the classification setting, the LOOCV error takes the form
\[
 \mbox{CV}_{(n)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n 1_{ \{ y_i \neq \widehat{y}_i \}},
\]
  where $1_{ \{ y_i \neq \widehat{y}_i \}}$ equals $1$ if $y_i \neq \widehat{y}_i$ and is zero if $y_i = \widehat{y}_i$.
- The $K$-fold CV error takes the form
\[
 \mbox{CV}_{(K)} = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{i=1}^K  \sum_{j=1}^{n_i}
    1_{ \{ y_j \neq \widehat{y}_j \}},
\]
where $n_i$ is the sample size of the $i$th fold.
