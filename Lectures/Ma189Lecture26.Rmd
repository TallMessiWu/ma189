# Time Series Regression and Autoregression

- It is tempting to regress time series data on time $t=1, \ldots, n$, as a covariate. Rarely does this provide satisfactory results (when used alone). 

## Regression on Time Trend

- Regression model with time trend:
\[
 X_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + Z_t.
\]
 Is $\{ Z_t \}$ i.i.d.? Usually: **No**.

### Example: U.S. Population

- Try  out time trend regression for U.S. population.

```{r}
pop <- read.table("USpop.dat")
pop <- ts(pop, start = 1901)
n <- length(pop)
time <- seq(1,n)
model1 <- lm(pop ~ time)
summary(model1)
plot(ts(model1$residuals))
```

- Highly structured residuals! We could add higher order polynomial effects to time trend, but it won't really help.

## Regression on Past of Self

- Let past values of the time series be the covariates. Called *Autoregression*.
- Autoregressive model:
\[
  X_t = \rho \, X_{t-1} + Z_t.
\]
Assume $\{ Z_t \}$ i.i.d. 

### Example: U.S. Population

- Try  out autoregression for U.S. population.

```{r}
model2 <- lm(pop[-1] ~ pop[-n])
summary(model2)
plot(ts(model2$residuals))
```

- Residuals are less structured, though maybe still not i.i.d.
- Why does this seem to work?

```{r}
cor(pop[-1],pop[-n])
plot(pop[-1],pop[-n],xlab="X Past",ylab="X Present")
```

## Incorporate Time Trend

- We can incorporate time trend into an autoregression.
- Do not do it this way
\[
 X_t = \rho X_{t-1} + \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + Z_t,
\]
 since this makes the mean ${\mathbf E} [ X_t ]$ depend on $\rho$.
- Instead, set up the model this way:
\begin{align*}
 Y_t & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + X_t \\
  X_t & = \rho \, X_{t-1} + Z_t.
\end{align*}

```{r}
model3 <- lm(pop[-1] ~ pop[-n] + time[-1])
summary(model3)
plot(ts(model3$residuals))
```

- Notice slope coefficient $\beta_1$ is not significant, and residuals resemble those of the pure autoregressive model. So not much benefit to using time covariate.


# The AR(1) Process

## Defining the Process

- Let $Z_t \sim \mbox{i.i.d.} (0,\sigma^2)$ and $\{ X_t \}$ defined via
\[
 X_t = \phi \, X_{t-1} + Z_t
\]
for $t \geq 1$, where $|\phi| < 1$.
- This is a recursion, called an *order 1 autoregression*, or AR(1).
- How to define $X_0$? If $X_0 \sim (0, \sigma^2/(1-\phi^2) )$, then $\mbox{Var} [X_t] = \mbox{Var}[ X_{t-1}]$! 
- This is an example of **stationarity** of a process.
 
```{r}
n <- 100
set.seed(123)
z <- rnorm(n)
x <- rep(0,n)
phi <- .9
x0 <- rnorm(1)/sqrt(1-phi^2)
x[1] <- phi*x0 + z[1]
for(t in 2:n) { x[t] <- phi*x[t-1] + z[t] }
plot(ts(x),xlab="Time",ylab="")
```

## What is the Mean?

- Suppose we put a constant in the autoregression:
\[
  X_t = \mu +  \phi \, X_{t-1} + Z_t.
\]
- Then the mean is
\[
  {\mathbb E} [ X_t ] = \mu + \phi \, {\mathbb E} [ X_{t-1} ].
\]
- If we assume *stationarity*, that the mean and variance don't depend on time $t$, then 
\[
 {\mathbb E} [ X ] = \mu + \phi \, {\mathbb E} [ X ].
\]
 This implies that 
\[
 {\mathbb E} [ X ] = \frac{\mu}{1 - \phi}.
\]
- So putting a constant $\mu$ in the regression is **not** the mean; we have to divide by $1 - \phi$ to get the mean.

## Fitting to Data

- Code the autoregression using linear regression.

```{r}
ar_mdl1 <- lm(x[-1] ~ x[-n] -1)
summary(ar_mdl1)
```

- We can also use time series packages.
- OLS is *Ordinary Least Squares*, and yields the same results. (Here the mean is the sample mean of the data, and does not equal the intercept coefficient in the regression.)

```{r}
ar_mdl2 <- ar.ols(x,order=1,aic=FALSE)
ar_mdl2$ar[,1,1]
ar_mdl2$x.mean
ar_mdl2$var.pred
```

- Another method is *Yule-Walker*, which is based on estimating so-called *autocovariances*.

```{r}
ar_mdl3 <- ar.yw(x,order=1,aic=FALSE)
ar_mdl3$ar
ar_mdl3$x.mean
ar_mdl3$var.pred
```

# The AR(p) Process

## Defining the Process

- Let $Z_t \sim \mbox{i.i.d.} (0,\sigma^2)$ and $\{ X_t \}$ defined via
\[
 X_t = \phi_1 \, X_{t-1} + \ldots \phi_p \, X_{t-p} + Z_t
\]
for $t \geq 1$.
- The coefficients $\phi_1,\ldots, \phi_p$ satisfy complicated *stability conditions*.
- This is a recursion, called an *order p autoregression*, or AR(p).
- There is also a stationary initialization involving the first $p$ observations, but this is covered in a full time series course.

## Simulation

- We can initialize with zeroes and utilize *burn-in*, which refers to an initial stretch of the simulation that is later discarded.
- Here is an example of an AR(2) with cyclic structure.

```{r}
n <- 100
burn <- 500
set.seed(444)
z <- rnorm(n+burn)
x <- rep(0,n+burn)
phi <- c(.9,-.81)
for(t in 3:(n+burn)) { x[t] <- phi[1]*x[t-1] + phi[2]*x[t-2] + z[t] }
x <- x[(burn+1):(burn+n)]
plot(ts(x),xlab="Time",ylab="")
```

## Fitting

- If we want to fit an AR model, what order should we use? 
- We could try resampling techniques, but they don't work so well with time series (unless they are modified).
- It is popular to use *information criteria*, which balance model fit against the number of model parameters.
- There is an information criterion (called AIC, for Akaike Information Criterion) in R.

```{r}
ar_mdl <- ar.ols(x)
ar_mdl$order
ar_mdl$ar[,1,1]
ar_mdl$x.mean
ar_mdl$var.pred
```
