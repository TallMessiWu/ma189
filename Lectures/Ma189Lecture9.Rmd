# Hypothesis Testing Problems on Population Mean Vectors

- Thus far the mean vector testing schemes we have discussed are based on comparing each component of two vectors.
- The problem of testing the equivalence of two vectors is decomposed into testing multiple univariate hypotheses.
- This type of testing scheme is called *multiple testing*.
- There are other ways to test the mean vector from one or multiple populations.

# Hotelling's $T^2$

## Hotelling’s $T^2$ (Univariate)

- Consider the square of the $t$-statistic for testing a univariate mean:
\[
 T^2 = \frac{ {(\overline{x} - \mu_0)}^2 }{ s^2/n } = 
 n (\overline{x} - \mu_0) s^{-1} (\overline{x}- \mu_0) \sim \mathcal{F}_{1,n-1}.
\]
- Squaring a $t$-distributed random variable with $n-1$ degrees of freedom gives rise to an $F$-distributed random variable with $1$ and $n-1$ degrees of freedom.
- We reject $H_0$ at level $\alpha$ if $T^2$ exceeds the critical value from the $\mathcal{F}_{1,n-1}$ distribution, for  level $\alpha$:
\[
 T^2 > \mathcal{F}_{1,n-1,\alpha}.
\]

```{r}
alpha <- .05
x <- rnorm(10,mean=1)
n <- length(x)
t_stat <- (mean(x) - 0)/(sd(x)/n)
t_stat^2
qf(1-alpha,df1=1,df2=n-1)
```

## Hotelling’s $T^2$ (Multivariate)

- Motivated by the univariate case, we define the Hotelling’s $T^2$ statistic for testing
a dimension $m$ mean vector 
\[
  T^2 = n {( \overline{\underline{x}} - \underline{\mu}_0)}^{\prime} {\mathbf S}^{-1}
  {( \overline{\underline{x}} - \underline{\mu}_0)}.
\]
- The difference between the sample mean and ${\mu}_0$ is replaced with the
difference between the sample mean vector and the hypothesized $\underline{\mu}_0$.
- The inverse of the sample variance is replaced by the inverse of the
sample covariance matrix  ${\mathbf S}$.

## Distribution of Hotelling’s $T^2$  (Large Sample)

- When sample size $n$ is large, we can ignore the estimation error of the variance-covariance matrix.
- If we replace the sample covariance matrix  ${\mathbf S}$. by the population covariance matrix ${\mathbf \Sigma}$, then $T^2$ is chi-square distributed with $m$ degrees of freedom.
\[
    n {( \overline{\underline{x}} - \underline{\mu}_0)}^{\prime} {\mathbf \Sigma}^{-1}
  {( \overline{\underline{x}} - \underline{\mu}_0)}  \sim \chi^2_{m}.
\]
- Therefore, when the sample size $n$ is large, $T^2$ is approximately chi-square distributed with $m$ degrees of freedom.

## Distribution of Hotelling’s $T^2$  (Small Sample)

- For small samples, the chi-square approximation for $T^2$  does not take into account the estimation error of estimating  ${\mathbf \Sigma}$ with  ${\mathbf S}$.
- Better results can be obtained from the following transformation of the Hotelling’s $T^2$ statistic:
\[
  F = \frac{n-m}{m (n-1)} T^2 \sim \mathcal{F}_{m,n-m}.
\]
- Under $H_0$, $F$ follows a $F$-distribution with $m$ and $n-m$ degrees of freedom.
- We reject the null hypothesis at level $\alpha$ if
\[
 F > \mathcal{F}_{m,n-m,\alpha}.
 \]

```{r}
alpha <- .05
x1 <- rnorm(10,mean=1)
x2 <- rnorm(10,mean=0)
x <- cbind(x1,x2)
n <- dim(x)[1]
m <- dim(x)[2]
f_stat <- (n-m)/(m*(n-1)) * t(colMeans(x)) %*% solve(var(x)) %*% colMeans(x)
f_stat
qf(1-alpha,df1=m,df2=n-m)
```

## Example: USDA Women’s Health Survey Data

- The recommended intake and sample mean are given below:

```{r}
nutrient <- read.table("nutrient.txt")
nutrient$V1=NULL
colnames(nutrient)=c("Calcium", "Iron", "Protein", "Vitamin A", "Vitamin C")
null_mu <- c(1000,15,60,800,75)
mu_mat <- cbind(null_mu,colMeans(nutrient))
colnames(mu_mat) <- c("Recommended Intake","Sample Mean")
mu_mat
```

- At a significance level $\alpha = .01$, test the following null and alternative hypotheses
using Hotelling’s $T^2$:
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu} = \underline{\mu}_0 \quad H_a: \underline{\mu} \neq \underline{\mu}_0.
\]
- Calculate sample covariance matrix ${\mathbf S}$:

```{r}
var(nutrient)
```

- The Hotelling’s $T^2$ can be calculated as 

```{r}
n <- dim(nutrient)[1]
hotel <- n*t(colMeans(nutrient)-null_mu) %*% 
  solve(var(nutrient)) %*% (colMeans(nutrient)-null_mu)
hotel
```

- The $F$-statistic can be calculated as 

```{r}
m <- 5
alpha <- .01
f_stat <- (n-m)/(m*(n-1)) * hotel
f_stat
qf(1-alpha,df1=m,df2=n-m)
```

- Conclusion: We reject the null, because the $F$-statistic exceeds the critical value.


# Compare Two Population Means

- Thus far, we have focused on testing if a population mean vector equals a specific vector:
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu} = \underline{\mu}_0 \quad H_a: \underline{\mu} \neq \underline{\mu}_0.
\]
- In some applications, we want to test the equivalence of two (unknown) population means, i.e.,
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} = \underline{\mu}^{(2)} \quad H_a: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} \neq \underline{\mu}^{(2)},
\]
where $\underline{\mu}^{(1)}$ and $\underline{\mu}^{(2)}$ are the mean vectors of two populations.
- This is a *two-sample testing* problem.

# Two-Sample Mean Testing Problems

- There are many applications, for example:

1. Test if there is a significant difference before and after a treatment.
2. Compare the reading ability of the students in two middle schools.
3. Check if a policy has a positive impact on reducing unemployment rate.
4. Can we classify two cities into the same class according to their weather conditions?
5. Which mobile phone company has better quality control? Samsung or Apple?

-  There are several aspects we need to consider before applying the test:

1. The data may either be paired or unpaired.
2. The sample sizes can be the same or different.
3. The covariance matrices of two populations can be equal or unequal (we often do not
know this in practice).

# Paired Samples

- *Paired samples* are samples where natural or matched couplings occur. This generates a dataset in which each data point in one sample is uniquely paired to a data point in the second sample.
- The two samples are one-to-one paired.

## Sample 1

- $n$ observations
- $m$ variables
- $\underline{x}_1^{(1)}, \ldots, \underline{x}_n^{(1)}$.
- Population parameters: $\underline{\mu}^{(1)}$, ${\mathbf \Sigma}^{(1)}$.
- Sample statistics: $\overline{\underline{x}}^{(1)}$, ${\mathbf S}^{(1)}$.

## Sample 2

- $n$ observations
- $m$ variables
- $\underline{x}_1^{(2)}, \ldots, \underline{x}_n^{(2)}$.
- Population parameters: $\underline{\mu}^{(2)}$, ${\mathbf \Sigma}^{(2)}$.
- Sample statistics: $\overline{\underline{x}}^{(2)}$, ${\mathbf S}^{(2)}$.
 
## Illustrations of Paired Samples:

1. Pre-test/post-test samples in which a factor is measured before and after an intervention.
2. Cross-over trials in which individuals are randomized to two treatments and then the same individuals are crossed-over to the alternative treatment.
3. Matched samples, in which individuals are matched on personal characteristics such as age and sex.
4. Duplicate measurements on the same biological samples.
5. Any circumstance in which each data point in one sample is uniquely matched to a data point in the second sample.  

## Example: Spouse Data

- A sample of 30 husband-wife pairs are asked to respond to each of the following questions:

1. What is the level of passionate love you feel for your partner?
2. What is the level of passionate love your partner feels for you?
3. What is the level of companionate love you feel for your partner?
4. What is the level of companionate love your partner feels for you?

- Responses were recorded on the five-point scale: 1 None at all, 2. Very little, 3. Some, 4. A great deal, 5. Tremendous amount

### Population/Sample 1: Husbands

- 30 observations
- 4 variables (responses to 4 questions)
- $\underline{x}^{(1)}_{i} = {[ x_{i1}^{(1)},  x_{i2}^{(1)},  x_{i3}^{(1)},  x_{i4}^{(1)} ]}^{\prime}$
- Population parameters: $\underline{\mu}^{(1)}$, ${\mathbf \Sigma}^{(1)}$.
- Sample statistics: $\overline{\underline{x}}^{(1)}$, ${\mathbf S}^{(1)}$.

### Population/Sample 2: Wives

- 30 observations
- 4 variables (responses to 4 questions)
- $\underline{x}^{(2)}_{i} = {[ x_{i1}^{(2)},  x_{i2}^{(2)},  x_{i3}^{(2)},  x_{i4}^{(2)} ]}^{\prime}$
- Population parameters: $\underline{\mu}^{(2)}$, ${\mathbf \Sigma}^{(2)}$.
- Sample statistics: $\overline{\underline{x}}^{(2)}$, ${\mathbf S}^{(2)}$.

### Questions of Interest

- Do the husbands respond to the questions in the same way as their wives?
- Do the husbands and wives accurately perceive the responses of their spouses?

### Question 1: Do the husbands respond to the questions in the same way as their wives?

- This is equivalent to asking whether the population mean vector of the husbands equals the population mean vector of the wives.
\[
  \mbox{Yes}: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} = \underline{\mu}^{(2)} \quad \mbox{No}: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} \neq \underline{\mu}^{(2)},
\]
To answer this question, we are interested in testing the following null
and alternative hypotheses:
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} = \underline{\mu}^{(2)} \quad H_a: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} \neq \underline{\mu}^{(2)},
\]

## Testing on Paired Samples

- We can re-write the null and alternative hypotheses as
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} - \underline{\mu}^{(2)} = \underline{0} \quad H_a: \underline{\mu}^{(1)} - \underline{\mu}^{(2)} \neq \underline{0}.
\]
Here $\underline{0}$ is the zero vector.
- This motivates us to consider a pair-wise difference of the two samples.
- Denote by $\underline{y}_i$ the (vector) difference in responses for the $i$th pair ($i$th husband and $i$th wife):
\[
 \underline{y}_i = \underline{x}^{(1)} - \underline{x}^{(2)}.
\]
- The population mean vector of $\underline{y}_i$ is
\[
 \underline{\mu}_y = \underline{\mu}^{(1)} - \underline{\mu}^{(2)}.
\]
- So we transform the two-sample testing problem to a one-sample problem:
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu}_y = \underline{0} \quad H_a: \underline{\mu}_y \neq \underline{0}.
\]

## Paired Hotelling’s $T^2$:

- Because $\underline{y}_i = \underline{x}^{(1)} - \underline{x}^{(2)}$ can be considered a new sample, we can calculate its sample mean vector and sample covariance matrix as
\[
 \overline{\underline{y}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \underline{y}_i \qquad
  {\mathbf S}_y = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n {(\underline{y}_i - \overline{\underline{y}} )}
   {(\underline{y}_i - \overline{\underline{y}} )}^{\prime}.
\]
- The paired Hotelling's $T^2$ test statistic is given by
\[
  T^2 = n \overline{\underline{y}}^{\prime} \, {\mathbf S}_y^{-1} \, \overline{\underline{y}}.
\]
- Then, we can define the $F$-statistic as
\[
  F = \frac{n-m}{m (n-1) } T^2 \sim \mathcal{F}_{m,n-m}.
\]
At a given significance level $\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ if
\[
 F > \mathcal{F}_{m,n-m,\alpha}.
\]

### Question 1: Do the husbands respond to the questions in the same way as their wives?

```{r}
spouse <- read.table("spouse.txt")
n <- dim(spouse)[1]
spouse_diff <- spouse[,1:4] - spouse[,5:8]
colMeans(spouse_diff)
hotel <- n*t(colMeans(spouse_diff)) %*% 
  solve(var(spouse_diff)) %*% (colMeans(spouse_diff))
hotel
m <- 4
alpha <- .05
f_stat <- (n-m)/(m*(n-1)) * hotel
f_stat
qf(1-alpha,df1=m,df2=n-m)
```

### Question 2: Do the husbands and wives accurately perceive the responses of their spouses?

- To understand this question, let us return to the four questions asked of each husband-wife pair. The questions were:

1. What is the level of passionate love you feel for your partner?
2. What is the level of passionate love your partner feels for you?
3. What is the level of companionate love you feel for your partner?
4. What is the level of companionate love your partner feels for you?

- A sub-question of question 2 is, does the wife accurately perceive the amount of passionate love her husband feels towards her?
- This is equivalent to asking, does the husband's answer to question 1 match the wife's answer to question 2?
- Mathematically, we formulate the question into the following null and alternative
hypotheses
\[
 H_0: \mu^{(1)}_1 - \mu^{(2)}_2 = 0 \quad H_a: \mu^{(1)}_1 - \mu^{(2)}_2 \neq 0.
\]
- To address question 2 we need to define four new variables as follows:

1. $z_{i,1} = x^{(1)}_{i,1} - x^{(2)}_{i,2}$ (husbands’ response to question 1 minus wives’ response to question 2).
2. $z_{i,2} = x^{(1)}_{i,2} - x^{(2)}_{i,1}$ (husbands’ response to question 2 minus wives’ response to question 1).
3. $z_{i,3} = x^{(1)}_{i,3} - x^{(2)}_{i,4}$ (husbands’ response to question 3 minus wives’ response to question 4).
4. $z_{i,4} = x^{(1)}_{i,4} - x^{(2)}_{i,3}$ (husbands’ response to question 4 minus wives’ response to question 3).
- Then, we transform the question 2 to the following mean testing problem:
\[
 H_0: \underline{\mu}_z = \underline{0} \quad H_a: \underline{\mu}_z \neq \underline{0}.
\]
- Use the paired Hotelling’s $T^2$ test.

```{r}
z <- data.frame(spouse[,1]-spouse[,6],spouse[,2]-spouse[,5],
                spouse[,3]-spouse[,8],spouse[,4]-spouse[,7])
colMeans(z)
hotel <- n*t(colMeans(z)) %*% solve(var(z)) %*% (colMeans(z))
hotel
m <- 4
alpha <- .05
f_stat <- (n-m)/(m*(n-1)) * hotel
f_stat
qf(1-alpha,df1=m,df2=n-m)
```

- Fail to reject! Conclusion: There is no clear evidence, according to the observed sample, to reject the hypothesis that husbands and wives accurately perceive the responses of their spouses.
