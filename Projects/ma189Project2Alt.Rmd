#  Iris Data 

Working alone, prepare a R Markdown Notebook report based on examining *Fisherâ€™s Iris Data* (available from GitHub). The iris dataset contains four measurements for $150$ iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.  

## Analysis

Is there a significant difference among the 3 group means for these 4 variables? Formulate the appropriate null hypothesis; choose a method of analysis (from the techniques discussed in class, using material up through Lecture 12); discuss the assumptions needed (and justify those assumptions, if possible); perform the analysis using R code (if you use a package, it is your responsibility to ensure their code does what you intend it to do); summarize the results with appropriate displays (figures and/or tables).
 

## Components to Your Report

This is your report, but consider including the following:

1. Introduction, Body, and conclusion.
2. Data citation.
3. Any relevant tools learned in lectures 1 through 12.  
4. Justify your analysis.

## Ethics

*Work alone!!!*

## Submission

Write an rmd file, render to pdf and submit the pdf.
